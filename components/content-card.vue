                        In the not-so-distant past, elders of the Savannah were
                        highly respected figures. Their word held immense
                        respect, and their wisdom could age like fine wine. What
                        defined their divine wisdom was their age,and the
                        experience they accumulated over the years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, the world has changed, and so is the role of the
                        elders. The age and wisdom relationship has disappeared.
                        In Savannah Tales, we believe that anyone can be an
                        elder. Anyone with valuable experience on any topic or
                        matter has divine wisdom, just like elders. Whether it
                        is a young professional crushing it in the corporate
                        world, or a veteran full of hard-earned insights. It
                        doesnâ€™t matter. As long as you have a burning desire to
                        share your stories.

                        Savannah Tales wants to home in all these insightful
                        perspectives, useful knowledge and life wisdom. Unlike
                        other platforms that are noisy and chaotic, Savannah
                        Tales is calm and serene, just like the shrines of the
                        Savannah.

                        Ultimately, our main goal is to embrace and spread the
                        Savannah culture through the power of writing. We
                        envision a world where Savannah culture stands alongside
                        great cultural legacies such as the ancient Greek and
                        the western culture.

                        We want to grow Savannah members who align with our
                        mission. Because our mission is to protect and spread
                        the Savannah culture, we cherish and promote valuable
                        stories that are deeply ingrained in the Savannah.
